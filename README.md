# Lab 1 - Reading Data from Different File Types

In Lab 1, I learned how to read and process data from various file formats using LangChain's document loaders. I explored how to extract text from `.txt` files using `TextLoader`, load PDF documents using `PyPDFLoader`, handle Markdown files with `UnstructuredMarkdownLoader`, and scrape content from web pages using `WebBaseLoader`. This lab helped me understand how to prepare different types of documents for further processing in AI applications.

## ðŸ“˜ Lab: Loading arXiv Research Papers & Extracting Text

In this lab, we worked on loading research papers from arXiv and extracting their text content for further processing.

### âœ… What We Did:

1. **Loading Data from arXiv**
   - Used the **`ArxivLoader`** class from the **LangChain** library to directly load research papers from arXiv by specifying paper IDs or search queries.
   - This loader simplifies fetching metadata and PDF content from arXiv.

2. **PDF Text Extraction using `pypdfium2`**
   - Utilized the **`pypdfium2`** Python library to open and extract text from downloaded PDF files.
   - This helped in handling multi-page PDFs and preserving formatting where possible.

3. **Data Preparation**
   - After extraction, the raw text was cleaned and structured to be ready for text splitting or NLP tasks.

This lab demonstrated an end-to-end pipeline for fetching academic research content from arXiv and converting it into machine-readable text using Python libraries.
