# Lab 1 - Reading Data from Different File Types

In Lab 1, I learned how to read and process data from various file formats using LangChain's document loaders. I explored how to extract text from `.txt` files using `TextLoader`, load PDF documents using `PyPDFLoader`, handle Markdown files with `UnstructuredMarkdownLoader`, and scrape content from web pages using `WebBaseLoader`. This lab helped me understand how to prepare different types of documents for further processing in AI applications.
